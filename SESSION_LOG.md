# Session Log & Resumption Guide

## 1. Project Overview & Goal

**Objective**: To perform a major refactor of the existing `apple-books-highlights` project. The goal is to merge its core data extraction capabilities with the more robust BibTeX enrichment and structured export workflow found in the `_reference_project` (`pdf-highlight-extraction`).

**Key Reference**: The code and file structure in the `_reference_project/` directory serve as the primary blueprint for this refactor.

**End State**: A script that queries the Apple Books database, enriches the data with a BibTeX library, and exports the results into strictly formatted Markdown (for Obsidian) and CSV files, as defined in `TECHNICAL.md`.

## 2. Our Workflow (Operating Instructions)

- **Single-Step Execution**: I will only execute one task or a single logical step at a time.
- **User Approval**: I must wait for your explicit approval before proceeding to the next step.
- **`TASKS.md` is the Source of Truth**: This file must be meticulously updated after any task is completed or any part of the plan is refined. It is our primary tracking document.
- **`TECHNICAL.md` is the Spec**: This file defines the final output format and technical requirements.
- **`SESSION_LOG.md` Maintenance**: This log must be kept current throughout our session. It should be updated with a detailed summary of progress before each `git commit` to ensure we can resume instantly if the session is interrupted.


## 3. Current Status (End of Session)

**Last Completed Milestone**: Phase 3: Integration & Workflow Orchestration.

- **Pipeline Implementation**: The main script `scripts/apple-books-highlights.py` has been completely refactored into a new orchestration engine. It now connects all the backend modules into a single, functional pipeline.
- **Append-Only Markdown**: A critical new feature for append-only Markdown exports has been fully implemented. The script now reads existing Markdown files, identifies already-exported highlights via hidden IDs, and only appends new ones. This prevents data loss for users who edit their exported notes.
- **Class-Based Refactor**: All core logic modules (`bib.py`, `export_json.py`, `export_md.py`, `export_csv.py`) have been refactored from functional scripts into a more robust, object-oriented class structure.
- **Database & Data Model Updates**: The database query in `booksdb.py` was updated to fetch unique annotation IDs. The Pydantic data models were updated to support this and to align with the database schema.
- **End-to-End Testing & Debugging**: The full pipeline has been successfully tested. Multiple runtime bugs were identified and fixed, including:
    - Python package dependency and installation issues (`ModuleNotFoundError`).
    - Python path resolution issues (solved with `pip install -e .`).
    - Configuration file errors (`KeyError`).
    - Pydantic v1 vs. v2 compatibility issues (`ValidationError`, `TypeError`).
- **Documentation**: The `TECHNICAL.md` and `TASKS.md` have been meticulously updated to reflect the new architecture, append-only feature, and installation/usage instructions.

## 4. Immediate Next Step (Start of Next Session)

- **Action**: Correct the final bug found during verification and then begin **Phase 4: Testing and Polish**.
- **First Task**: Fix the bug where highlight text is missing in the generated Markdown files. This was traced to an incorrect `by_alias` setting during JSON serialization.
- **Second Task**: After fixing the bug and re-running the sync, perform a second run to explicitly verify the append-only logic for Markdown files.
