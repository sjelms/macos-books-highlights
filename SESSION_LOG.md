# Session Log & Resumption Guide

## 1. Project Overview & Goal

**Objective**: To perform a major refactor of the existing `apple-books-highlights` project. The goal is to merge its core data extraction capabilities with the more robust BibTeX enrichment and structured export workflow found in the `_reference_project` (`pdf-highlight-extraction`).

**Key Reference**: The code and file structure in the `_reference_project/` directory serve as the primary blueprint for this refactor.

**End State**: A script that queries the Apple Books database, enriches the data with a BibTeX library, and exports the results into strictly formatted Markdown (for Obsidian) and CSV files, as defined in `TECHNICAL.md`.

## 2. Our Workflow (Operating Instructions)

- **Single-Step Execution**: I will only execute one task or a single logical step at a time.
- **User Approval**: I must wait for your explicit approval before proceeding to the next step.
- **`TASKS.md` is the Source of Truth**: This file must be meticulously updated after any task is completed or any part of the plan is refined. It is our primary tracking document.
- **`TECHNICAL.md` is the Spec**: This file defines the final output format and technical requirements.
- **`SESSION_LOG.md` Maintenance**: This log must be kept current throughout our session. It should be updated with a detailed summary of progress before each `git commit` to ensure we can resume instantly if the session is interrupted.


## 3. Current Status (End of Session)

**Last Completed Milestone**: Phase 2: Core Logic Implementation.

- **File Structure**: All new modules (`bib.py`, `export_json.py`, `export_md.py`, `export_csv.py`) have been created in the `apple_books_highlights/` directory, mirroring the reference project's structure.
- **Dependencies**: `requirements.txt` has been created and `setup.py` has been updated with all necessary packages.
- **Core Logic**: The modules have been populated with the core logic for BibTeX handling, JSON creation, and templated Markdown/CSV exporting.
- **Configuration**: `config.yaml` has been created and populated with default values.
- **Planning**: `TASKS.md` is fully updated, with Phases 1 and 2 checked off.

## 4. Immediate Next Step (Start of Next Session)

- **Action**: Begin **Phase 3: Integration & Workflow Orchestration**.
- **First Task**: **T015**, which involves refactoring the main script `scripts/apple-books-highlights.py` to orchestrate the entire new workflow by tying together all the modules we created in Phase 2.
